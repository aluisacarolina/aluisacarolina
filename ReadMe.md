<h1 align="left">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm LuÃ­sa</h1>
<h2 align="left">Data analyst by day, gym enthusiast by night, and a full-time problem solver.</h2>
<p align="left">
Born and raised on the beautiful Madeira Island, Iâ€™ve spent the past nine years in Lisbon, embracing its vibrant charm.
I work at NTT as both an analyst and developer, where I talk with business units, understand their needs, and develop solutions that combine technical knowledge with innovation. With a background in biomedical engineering and a passion for deep learning (thanks to a recent bootcamp), I enjoy solving complex problems and building insightful solutions.
I thrive on routines: working, reading, and hitting the gym keep me grounded. At the same time, I love exploring new ideas, experimenting with recipes, and discovering unfamiliar places. I enjoy finding the right mix between consistency and new experiences. </p>
