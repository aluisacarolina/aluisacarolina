<h1 align="left">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm LuÃ­sa</h1>
<h2 align="left">Data analyst by day, gym enthusiast by night, and a full-time problem solver.</h2>
<p align="left">
At NTT DATA, I turn messy datasets into strategic insightsâ€”currently working with EDP to make data make sense. With a background in biomedical engineering and a newfound love for deep learning, I enjoy tackling complex challenges (both in code and in life).
Outside of work, I enjoy watching up-and-coming stand-up comedians, reading books, and trying to cook something other than the chicken I eat every day. Always learning, always exploring, and always up for a new challenge!  </p>
